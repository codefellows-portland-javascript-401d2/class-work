# Class 06: Writing servers with Node.js

## Feedback: Thank You!

* Postive feedback on Whiteboarding?!?
* Remember, unless explicitly mentioned, all assignments can be pair/mob
* Haven't graded assignments yet
	* Travis CI passed when I turned it on!
	* Prima fascia looks really good
	* Test First having positive impact
* Pace:
	* Okay?
	* More reading first couple of weeks, then lightens up
* Yes, I will try and slow down and pause more!
* Hoping to get Nichole Shannon hired ASAP
* Temperature - what to do?

## Roadmap

* Last Week: JavaScript and Node Fundamentals
* This Week: Server Fundamentals with Node
	* [week 2 canvas module](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1022347/modules)
* Next Week: Middleware (Express.js) and Data (MongoDB)

## Today's Learning Objectives

* ChaiJS

1. Write and run and TCP server with Node.js
2. Write and run a basic hello world HTTP server with Node.js

## Tomorrow's Learning Objectives

1. Create TCP and HTTP clients using Node.js
2. Differentiate HTTP requests based on path (url) and verb (http) and other request factors
3. E2E servers using Mocha (and chai-http for HTTP)

## Labs

There are two labs today, and follow-ons to both labs tomorrow:

* [TCP Chat Server](https://github.com/codefellows-portland-javascript-401d2/tcp-chat-server)
* [HTTP Hello/Goodbye World](https://github.com/codefellows-portland-javascript-401d2/http-hello-goodbye-world)

## Overview

### Application Architecture
	* Client _(browser, mobile, IoT)_
	* Server _(Node.js)_
	* Database _(MongoDB)_

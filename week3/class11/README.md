* Slowed down pace, now more pause and dialog Q&A
* Long Readings:
	* Yes, they were backwards. 
	* It was an experiment. It failed.
* Learning to Learn
	* How will you navigate situations where you "lack" ________?
	* Remember it's about your career in tech
* You are best group of students, top to bottom, I have seen
* Now the real fun starts
	* Many code schools start students on ExpressJS where we are this week

## 1-on-1

## Today's Learning Objectives

* Setup app routing _with ExpressJS_ correctly using 
route matching, parameters, and order of routes
* “Starting” an express app, just _httpServer_, ie .listen() vs http.createServer(app)
* Serve static assets using `express.static`
* Server serve rendered pages using `jade` and `render.view`

## Overview

* routing
	* method based functions (`app.get`)
	* regex
	* order
	* parameters
	* `express.Router()`
	* `app.use()`
* static files
* rendered views

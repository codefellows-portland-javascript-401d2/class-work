# Class 05: DS&A: Arrays, Dictionaries, Whiteboarding

## Assignment Feedback: Parallel File Lab

* use node `err, results` for your asychronous methods
* second test for file order!
* list of files vs directory
* review for naming, esp module/function name
* http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-console
* Refactoring !== change behavior

## Orientation

Remember, about your career in tech!

* Friday!
* [Good news](https://blog.bloc.io/comparing-salaries-for-coding-bootcamps-vs-computer-science-degrees/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTm1Ga1pqZGtZV1JsTURObSIsInQiOiJnWHNWdG5WQlpzWlpjdXBlTk1mMDF2VHlmTXZwanpyNW4wZkVRMFRzd1VOS2MwTE4yM0Z5QXpKOEVXYzB1U0NxcG1YeHNZdE5KdXQwZTdqOWZIS3NZMHhPaGlYQUlBUTFKTE5yME4rbUlwMD0ifQ%3D%3D)!
	* Income trajectory
* After Code Fellows, entering job search phase
* ~~Whiteboarding~~ Demonstrative skills
	* Good 
	* Bad - low correlation, no tracking false negatives 
	* Ugly - enforces biases
* Let's mine good whiteboard skills to make you a more attractive candidate

## Learning Objectives

1. Explain the scaling characteristics (graph shape) and give examples of 
	`O(1)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n)`, `O(n^2)`, and `O(2^n)` 
complexity functions.
2. Evaluate existing code to determine Big O in time or space
3. Understand differences and uses of arrays and dictionaries (hashes)
4. Learn how-to whiteboard and "why"

# Greeting App Part 2

## Clarifications

If `npm i && npm test` doesn't run and pass, your assignment will not be graded going forward.

"Add at least one new option to the greet function" was intended to change API of greet function.

"Use at least one third-party npm library, example: add icon/art/emoji greeting" was intended to
make you use npmjs.org.

`package.json` needs to be inside `@username`, don't create a separate folder inside your @username.

You _must_ have README.md that explains steps for _how to test_ and _how to dev_

Change log "template" uses `[ ... ]` explicitly

Change log items should be developer facing

## Observations

* foo( main, options )
* Changelog optional, but encouraged, for rest of class
